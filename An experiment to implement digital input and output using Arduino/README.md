1. Connect the **positive leg (longer leg)** of the LED to a jumper wire.  
2. Connect the **resistor** to the same jumper wire as the LED's positive leg.  
3. Connect the other end of the resistor to a **digital output pin** on the Arduino Uno (e.g., pin 13).  
4. Connect **one leg of the pushbutton switch** to another jumper wire.  
5. Connect the other leg of the switch to a **digital input pin** on the Arduino Uno (e.g., pin 2).  
6. Connect the **remaining switch leg** to the **GND (ground) pin** on the Arduino Uno.

## ✅ Results

Once the program was uploaded to the Arduino:  

- The **LED attached to pin 13** blinked on and off at one-second intervals (or as controlled by button input).  
- This demonstrated successful use of both the **digital output capabilities** of the Arduino and basic principles of electronic circuit design.

## 🏁 Conclusion

- This lab effectively demonstrated how to control a simple LED using an **Arduino Uno**.  
- By using basic components like LEDs, resistors, and an Arduino, one can create a simple circuit that teaches **fundamental electronic and programming principles**.
