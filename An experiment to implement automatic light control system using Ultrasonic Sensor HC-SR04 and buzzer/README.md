## ‚öôÔ∏è Procedure
1. **Setup the Hardware:**
   - Connect the **VCC** pin of the HC-SR04 to the **5V** pin on the Arduino.  
   - Connect the **GND** pin of the HC-SR04 to the **GND** pin on the Arduino.  
   - Connect the **TRIG** pin of the HC-SR04 to **digital pin 9** on the Arduino.  
   - Connect the **ECHO** pin of the HC-SR04 to **digital pin 10** on the Arduino.  
   - Connect the **LED‚Äôs anode** (longer leg) to **digital pin 13** on the Arduino through a **220Œ© resistor**.  
   - Connect the **LED‚Äôs cathode** (shorter leg) to **GND** on the Arduino.  
   - Connect the **buzzer‚Äôs positive terminal** to **digital pin 12** on the Arduino.  
   - Connect the **buzzer‚Äôs negative terminal** to **GND** on the Arduino.  

2. **Programming the Microcontroller:**
   - Write a program to measure the distance using the ultrasonic sensor.  
   - Turn on the LED and sound the buzzer when the measured distance is less than a predefined threshold.  
   - Upload the program to the Arduino using the **Arduino IDE**.

## üìä Results
- After completing the circuit and uploading the code, the system automatically turns on the LED and sounds the buzzer when an object is detected within the threshold distance.  
- The LED and buzzer turn off when the object moves away beyond the threshold distance.  

---

## üí¨ Discussion
- The experiment successfully demonstrates the use of an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of an object and control a light and buzzer based on the detection.  
- The **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** accurately measures the distance, and the Arduino code effectively turns on the LED and sounds the buzzer when an object is within the specified range.  
- Adjusting the distance threshold can adapt the system for various applications.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
This experiment illustrates a simple yet effective way to implement an **automatic light control system** using an ultrasonic sensor and a buzzer. The setup can be extended to other applications where proximity detection is required, such as:  
- Automated door openers  
- Obstacle detection systems  
- Interactive projects  

Adjusting the threshold distance enhances the system's versatility and applicability.
